# Project-BlueBook-AI-OCR-Correction


**Motivation and Backstory**

Project Blue Book was the U.S. Air Force's third official investigation into unidentified flying objects and ran from 1952 to 1969.
The aforementioned files contained 12,618 reported sightings.  Of these, 701 remained unexplained.
While the official conclusion of the report was that UFOs pose no risk to US national security,
the 2015 nonredacted release of the BlueBook files has reignited the
long-standing public interest in UFOs, Cold War secrecy, and the search for extraterrestrial life.

When granting the documents public internet access the National Archives used Optical Character Recognition to produce text files
of the documents alongside pdf scans of the originals.  Some documents are even accomponied by a human written transcription.
However, the OCR for these documents is often incorrect, completely unreadable in many instances, and the human transcription
is not available for many of the documents.


**What is Different About this Repository? / Future Goals**

Using the Open AI API we have succesfully corrected the optical character recognition of the BlueBook documents.
This vastly improve searchability and accesability to the information contained in these documents.
For example if users want to see the mention of a specific name, place, or phenomemon within these UFO sightings, they can do so at the click of a button.
Our long term goal is to the make this process generalized to other government document files collections on the national archive, promoting
greater accessability to the declassified materials in the public domain.

**Process**
Of the 112,000+ pages digitally available, 57,434 have extracted OCR text.   Each of those pages was sent to OpenAIâ€™s API along with our system prompt which is 412 tokens in length.  This consumed 42,424,927 input tokens ( 23,662,808 for prompts plus 18,762,119 for transmitting the original OCR text); and returned 17,289,505 output tokens.  Running the model gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 required approximately 80 hours of compute time, for a total cost of $16.89.    


For the first time you can digitally search the full set of 100,00 Project Bluebook pages, from the US National Archives.  AI was used to correct the OCR errors in the original scanned documents.
